# Contributing to Workbench

## Project Philosophy

Workbench is my personal command-line toolkit and automation workspace. It's primarily designed to serve my own needs and preferences, while also being a playground for me to explore and learn Go. While I welcome contributions and ideas from others, please understand that this project's primary goal is to be useful to me personally.

## For Contributors

If you're interested in contributing, here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

1. **Personal Focus**: Features and changes should align with my personal workflow and needs. If you have a feature request, please open an issue to discuss it first.

2. **Code Style**:
   - Follow Go's standard formatting and conventions
   - Keep code simple and maintainable
   - Write clear, concise documentation
   - Include tests for new features

3. **Project Structure**:
   - Each command should be self-contained and focused
   - Keep dependencies minimal
   - Prefer standard library solutions when possible
   - Document any external dependencies clearly

4. **Documentation**:
   - Update README.md for new features
   - Include usage examples
   - Document any configuration options
